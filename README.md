This repository contains my solutions to assignments given in this course. Here is a brief summary of assignments with their respective links:
+ [Assignment 1](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment2.html): To implement linear regression and linear-threshold classification using scikit-learn. Dataset used: [-random data-](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assign1_data.txt)
+ [Assignment 2](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment2.html): To implement a one-hidden-layer back propagation network to process real data without using Tensorflow / any other library. Dataset used: [Room occupancy detection data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+).
+ [Assignment 3](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment3.html): Exploring tensorflow. Implement Hinton Family Trees. Dataset used: [Family Relations](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/family_trees/relations.txt)
+ [Assignment 4](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment4.html): To use tensorflow to explore convolutional nets and to optimize a network for [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.
+ [Assignment 5](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment5.html): The goal of this assignment is to look through the literature, find interesting research, and write a commentary about one paper that you found that you feel is noteworthy. I chose the paper [The Neural Conversational Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869v3).
