This repository contains my solutions to assignments given in this course. Here is a brief summary of assignments with their respective links:
+ [Assignment 1](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment2.html): To implement linear regression and linear-threshold classification using scikit-learn. Dataset used: [-random data-](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assign1_data.txt)
+ [Assignment 2](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment2.html): To implement a one-hidden-layer back propagation network to process real data without using Tensorflow / any other library. Dataset used: [Room occupancy detection data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+).
+ [Assignment 3](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment3.html): Exploring tensorflow. Implement Hinton Family Trees. Dataset used: [Family Relations](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/family_trees/relations.txt)
+ [Assignment 4](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment4.html): To use tensorflow to explore convolutional nets and to optimize a network for [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.
+ [Assignment 5](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment5.html): The goal of this assignment is to look through the literature, find interesting research, and write a commentary about one paper that you found that you feel is noteworthy. I chose the paper [The Neural Conversational Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869v3).
+ [Assignment 6](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment6.html): Implementing vanilla RNN and LSTM to learn a parity operator. Executed on [Summit Haswell](https://www.rc.colorado.edu/resources/compute/summit) Supercomputer at CU Boulder's Research Computing. Used SLURM workload manager. Code credits: [Tensorflow-Examples](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/3_NeuralNetworks/dynamic_rnn.ipynb).
+ [Assignment 7 Final Project](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment7.html): Deep Knowledge Tracing on Fractions with [Shirly Berends, Ph.D. student at CU Boulder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirly-berends-montero-8aba639/); [Sean Kelly, VP Engineering and Co-Founder at Woot Math](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-kelly-2406baa/); [Brent Milne, VP Research and Co-Founder at Woot Math Simbulus, Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbmilne/).
