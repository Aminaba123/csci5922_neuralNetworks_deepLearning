Dataset used: [-random data-](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assign1_data.txt)
+ [Assignment 2](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/DeepLearningFall2017/assignments/assignment2.html): To implement a one-hidden-layer back propagation network to process real data without using Tensorflow / any other library. Dataset used: [Room occupancy detection data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+).
